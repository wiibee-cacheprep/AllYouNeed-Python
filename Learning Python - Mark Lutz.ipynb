    "# Chapter 1: A Python Q & A Session\n",
    "1. Why Python?\n",
    "    - Software quality: Python code is designed to be readable, and hence reusable and maintainable.\n",
    "    - Developer productivity: Less to type, less to debug, and less to maintain\n",
    "    - Program portability: Most Python programs run unchanged on all major computer platforms\n",
    "    - Support libraries: large collection of prebuilt and portable functionality + third-party library ecosystem\n",
    "    - Component integration: Python scripts can easily communicate with other parts of an application - C | C++ | Java\n",
    "    - Enjoyment: Python programming is more pleasure than chore\n",
    "2. Why not Python?\n",
    "    - Execution speed may not always be as fast as that of fully compiled and lower-level languages such as C and C++\n",
    "    - However, Python code runs fast enough by itself in most application domains\n",
    "3. How does Python work? Does it compile?\n",
    "    - standard implementations of Python today compile (i.e., translate) source code state- ments to an intermediate format known as byte code and then interpret the byte code. Byte code provides portability, as it is a platform-independent format.\n",
    "    - Python is not normally compiled all the way down to binary machine code (e.g., instructions for an Intel chip), some programs will run more slowly in Python than in a fully compiled language like C.\n",
    "4. Products using Python\n",
    "    - Google, Youtube, Dropbox, Netflix\n",
    "5. Reference:\n",
    "    - https://www.python.org/about/success/\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. Usage of Python\n",
    "    - Systems Programming\n",
    "    - GUIs\n",
    "    - Internet Scripting\n",
    "    - Component Integration\n",
    "    - Database Programming\n",
